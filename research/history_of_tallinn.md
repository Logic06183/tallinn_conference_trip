# A Brief History of Tallinn

Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, has a rich and complex history, having been a key player in the region for centuries. Here is a brief overview of its history:

## Early History

The first traces of human settlement in what is now Tallinn date back around 5,000 years. The first fortress was built on Toompea hill around 1050, which became the centre of the ancient Estonian province of RÃ¤vala.

## Danish and Hanseatic Period

In 1219, the Danes conquered the area and built a new fortress on Toompea. The name Tallinn is believed to have derived from the Estonian "Taani-linn(a)", meaning "Danish-castle". The city, then known as Reval, joined the Hanseatic League in 1285, becoming an important trading hub.

## Swedish and Russian Rule

In 1561, during the Livonian War, Tallinn became a dominion of Sweden. This period, often referred to as the "good old Swedish times", lasted for nearly 140 years. In 1710, during the Great Northern War, Tallinn capitulated to the Russian Empire.

## Independence and Soviet Era

On 24 February 1918, the Estonian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed in Tallinn. However, this independence was short-lived, as Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. During the Soviet era, Tallinn hosted the sailing events of the 1980 Summer Olympics.

## Modern Era

In August 1991, Estonia re-established its independence, and Tallinn once again became its capital. The city's well-preserved Old Town was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997 and continues to be a major tourist attraction.
